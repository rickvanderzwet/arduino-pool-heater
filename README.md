arduino-pool-heater
===================


##Intro
This is an [OpenCommunityCamp.org](http://opencommunitycamp.org/site/) project.

Pool heater developed with Arduino Board. It controls the waterflow by an
controlling 12v pump, based on the temperature of sensors attached to a solar
collector.

Two design goals:
* Most effient heating.
* Hottest water output (for melting candles). 


##Hardware
* 5m^3 inflatable swimmingpool.
* SRU Solar collector.
* Arduino development board.

## Schematics
* Temperature readings with termistors.
* PWM circuit with MOSMET.

## Credits
* Hardware Design - 8. 
* Arduino code - 8.
* Graphing - Rick van der Zwet <info@rickvanderzwet.nl>

##Special Thanks
* [ThermosPower.nl](http://thermospower.nl) for providing the SRU solar collector.
